        <h3>Me as producer</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Tygo Hiemstra or online known as Tygeau. I am 18 years old and I've been making music since I first opened my first illegal copy of Fruity loops 7.<br>
        I mostly produce hip-hop and RnB, but I have recently opened my tool kit with a bunch more genres, with the goal to become an all around producer that is ready for any job.<br> <p></p>
        Most of my work is solo but I have worked together with other artists.</p><br> 
        
        <h3>Current short term goals</h3>
        <p>
            I currently work in ableton where I have produced nearly all of my projects and I am currently learning how to use protools because my main goal is to become a mixing/mastering engineer. But being a decent producer is a great start. My work is very recognizable because of 1 of my producer tags going "Damn Tygeau, Who's making this beat?"</b>
            You can also hear it if a track is made with mostly bells or pluck sounds or even slowing a track down at the end for a weird psychedelic feeling inspired by the chopped and screwed style invented by the legend DJ SCREW.
        </p>

        <p>My second goal for this portfolio is to network with people for collaborations and other stuff. I have worked with other artists before which helped me a lot with producing tracks and keeping it simple, because my older work is really all over the place in terms of production.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I mostly produce from the comfort of my own home where I have most of my equipment. Here is a list of some of the hardware I use:</p>

        <p class="list">Laptop Asus vivobook <br> Scarlet Focusrite Solo 3rd Gen <br> BD DT 770 pro 70ohm</p>
